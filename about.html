	<h1>About Us</h1>

	<div id="whoAbout">
		<h2>Who We Are</h2>
		<p> We're three college students who believe that being warm is a human right
		and that no one should be left to freeze in the winter cold.Inspired by our own
		personal struggles with the unpredictable New York City weather, we set out on a 
		mission to make sure no one was forced to freeze. </p>
	</div>
	<div id="whatAbout">
		<h2>What we do</h2>
		<p> We use donations to help provide heat to those that need it most, whether you're in a 
		classroom, an apartment, or outside on the streets, we aim to make sure that everyone has
		access to a warm location, where they can escape cold weather.</p>
		<p> We target public places like libraries and recreational community spaces, working with 
		organizers to provide a heated space. By renting out these otherwise empty spaces, we are able
		to create what we like to call "heat shelters" for anyone that needs to warm up.</p>

		<h2>Our Programs</h2>
		<h3>Heat Pods</h3>
		<p>The "Heat Pods" program provides those in need with portable heaters for their homes.
		We get the heaters from donations or purchase them with grants we have applied for and obtained.
		All of the heaters donated or bought are required to be new so we ensure that everyone gets the best 
		heating experience they can. To find out where to donate a heater click <a href="">here</a></p>

		<h3>Heat Shelters</h3>
		<p>The "Heat Shelters" program allows everyone access to a free, warm location. We work with partners to provide 
		the public with access to a warm location. This program started when we noticed that during the winter season, people
		would walk through stores in order to avoid the cold weather, even if it was for a short time.</p>

		<h3>Heat Stops</h3>
		<p>The "Heat Stops" program is a work in progress. If we get enough <a href="">donations</a> we want
		to bring heated bus stops to the streets of New York City. We hope that the next generation will never
		have to stand in the freezing cold, wondering whether or not the next bus is ever going to make it. If this 
		project gets successfully funded, no longer will New Yorkers have to risk frostbite while waiting for their morning commute.  </p>
